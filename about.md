# About

Hi, I'm a software engineer interested in machine learning and Deep learning.
I have written couple of data driven articles on kaggle and medium.

# [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/poonaml) 

### Competitions 
1. Won a bronze medal for Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge organized by Google Research.(Top 10 %)
2. Participated in APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection (Top 12%)

### Kernels
1. [Deep Neural Network Keras way](https://www.kaggle.com/poonaml/deep-neural-network-keras-way) 
2. [Last cab to New York](https://www.kaggle.com/poonaml/last-cab-to-new-york-animated-heatmap-trips-folium) (Won award in Best Visualization category)
3. [Real estate prediction on Zillow with prophet](https://www.kaggle.com/poonaml/real-estate-prediction-on-zillow-with-prophet) (Won weekly kernel award)

# [Medium](https://medium.com/@poonam.v.ligade)
Wrote a blog post about weight intialization in neural networks in Towards Data Science Publication.
