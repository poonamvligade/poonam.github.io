# About

Hi there! I'm Poonam 👋 👩‍💻

I'm a software engineer interested in machine learning and Deep learning.
I have written couple of data driven articles on kaggle and medium.
I’m currently working on making AI accessible and affordable to masses at Jarvislabs.ai.
 I’m learning MLOps (How to put ML in production)
